                    Tbilisi State Medical University is the main center of higher medical education in Georgia, which has a centuries-old history of development. Higher medical education in our country is similarly older. It is proud that thousands of graduates of Tbilisi State Medical University are currently decorating many leading clinics and institutions in Georgia, Europe and around the world.
                    The role and responsibility of Tbilisi State Medical University in ensuring the health of the population of our country is great and honorable. In carrying out this important mission, Tbilisi State Medical University is guided by the basic principles that define its activities, which are:
                    Academic degree of knowledge and research;
                    Democracy;
                    Selectivity and transparency of governing bodies;
                    Academic freedom of academic staff and students.
                    In 2018, the University successfully and unconditionally passed the authorization. According to the decision of the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME), from 2023 in the Euro-Atlantic space will be recognized only the diploma of the university whose medical programs will pass international accreditation. We are now preparing for this important step.
                    The successful progress of undergraduate, postgraduate and continuous professional education, master's and doctoral programs, higher professional education programs makes the Medical University attractive not only to young people in Georgia, but also to young people around the world.
                    Tbilisi State Medical University is a full member of the European Educational Space, which means its active role in the functioning of this educational system, in defining and implementing development directions, in establishing free and close scientific and educational contacts with foreign educational, scientific and clinical centers.
                    It is a great recognition that on May 23, 2019, a representative office of the European Association for Medical Education - AMEE was established at Tbilisi State Medical University (currently the association has expanded to include 110 countries and received the status of an international association) in Georgia. Which is a success not only of TSMU, but also of the country: Georgia has become an international center of medical education, which is an important step towards integration into the European educational space.
                    Confirmation of the international recognition of Tbilisi State Medical University is that Tbilisi State Medical University is attractive today for more than 2800 young people from 80 countries, which means that every third student at our university is an international student.
                    The strategic goal of Tbilisi State Medical University is to continuously develop the quality of education, to maintain TSMU's reputation as a traditionally distinguished medical education center in accordance with national and WFME standards, both in Georgia and in the international arena.
                    Every year, more than 600 students, residents, academic and administrative staff, scientists, doctors and nurses of our university participate in short and long-term international mobility programs.
